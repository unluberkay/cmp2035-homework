                  <h4>What is the problem?</h4>
                  Andrew is a 22 year old analyst working at Goldman Sachs. After a long day of working at his office, he leaves his office building in downtown New York and starts heading to his apartment. On his way he stops by a CVS to get some junk food and some beer. Walking to the the cashier he realizes that there is a huge line in front of the cashier. But Andrew keeps his calm and heads to the self­checkout. However, what is that! Another huge line. “F*ck!” cries Andrew. Andrew becomes aware of the fact that cashiers and self checkouts are inefficient and just plain dull. What will Andrew do? To be continued...
                  <h4>What is the solution?</h4>
                  While waiting on the self checkout line, Andrew sees the ad for Shop n Go app. He downloads the app to his iPhone (can also be android. It is just I have never seen an analyst with an android phone...) First, he registers through his phone number. Then he scans his credit card to save it into the app which is stored within the device. Then he scans the barcodes of the products he just got. After he scanned his still cold beer a pop up shows up on his screen telling him that there is a coupon for purchase that he can use next time when he buys the same beer. Oh the cool thing is that the coupon is, also, stored on his device and enters itself automatically without any input. At the end the app shows him the Total including the tax! (Talk about innovation!). When he presses the “BUY” button he is done. He gets off the line, takes a one last look at the suckers on the line and laughs like an evil, hoping nobody heard him.
                  <br />
                  This is the main problem and solution. There are also possibilities of providing retailers with metadata, real time and relevant advertisement (If a person scans a product the system can either offer something to go with it or something instead of the product he or she scanned.)
